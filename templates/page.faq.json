Active ingredients are ingredients that create a physiological change in the body. For example, a Panadol capsule would contain the active ingredient inside the capsule however, the capsule itself would be ‘inactive’ as it is only the carrier for the medication.<\/p><p>It is important to use skim milk whilst on the Platinum shakes as they are not nutritionally complete without this added ingredient. However, the Platinum shakes can be made up with water, almond or coconut milk as a snack. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Please note: <\/span>when mixing with anything other than milk, it will change the nutrient values depicted on the nutritional panel such as calories and fats, making it difficult to track how much of each nutrient you are having daily.<\/p>"
